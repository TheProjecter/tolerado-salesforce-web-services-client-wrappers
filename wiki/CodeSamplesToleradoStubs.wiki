{{{
// All the hassle of doing login and setting headers encapsulated in
// this single call
// ToleradoStub is a ready to use stub, with no changes required
ToleradoStub pStub = ToleradoStubRegistry
        .getPartnerStub(new Credential(&quot;userName@user.com&quot;, &quot;password&quot;));
// Binding created transparently from the given salesforce user name
// password.
// You transparently got the
// 1. Fault recovery mechanism
// 2. Cached stub (if its second call via the same login)
// 3. QueryResult is same class as before, so no change on your rest of
// the
// logic.
QueryResult qr = pStub.query(&quot;select FirstName, LastName from Contact&quot;);
// ...
// process the results within QueryResult
// ...
