As of now this project is wrapping stubs generated via Apache Axis 1.4. Later we will try to address other WSDL2Java generators. So this guide is for you if you are using or planning for Apache Axis 1.4.

= Getting Started with TOLERADO =
 * Prerequisites
 * Setup an IDE
 * Run locally in development mode
 * Run in production mode


== Prerequisites ==
 # You will need to download latest tolerado-x.x.jar from [http://code.google.com/p/tolerado-salesforce-web-services-client-wrappers/downloads/list here].
 # This is optional, if you haven't done WSDL2Java over Partner, Metadata and Apex WSDLs. You can download these jars(sfdc-<WSDL NAME>.jar) from the [http://code.google.com/p/tolerado-salesforce-web-services-client-wrappers/downloads/list download page]. All these Jars are having classes generated from Apache Axis 1.4 WSDL2Java. If you have already done so, you can use you existing code.
 # Download other dependencies, as of now we are depending on these libraries minimal version indicated axis.jar (1.4), commons-discovery-0.2.jar, commons-lang-2.5.jar, commons-logging-1.1.1.jar, jaxrpc.jar, log4j-1.2.16.jar, wsdl4j-1.6.2.jar.
